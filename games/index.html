<h1>Games</h1>
<p>Okay this is the game section, which is under construction</p>
<!--
One idea is to implement a lot of games here in iframes, and make a dropdown list to select
them, so that it is still a rather seamless experience to view this site!.
Another crazy idea, putting a list of games that load the given game in a iframe.
